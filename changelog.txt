//------------ChangeLog for Research OpenFoam Case-------------------//

Starting with Case1c_retry, based off of the import of the last working
and tested case directory from the FERMI server, case4_ReadyToRun.tar.gz.
The changelog was started on 7/01/2021 in order to keep track of changes
and the results of the changes to the program to try to narrow down and
track the possible cause of the problem with the simulation

Key for ChangeLog:

{7/01/2021}

%% case1c_retry branched from case4_ReadyToRun.tar.gz
$ Unchanged from being unpacked, makes it to 3e-05 w/o lowering timestep
# 1 - [meshCreationFiles/0.noInternal/T]
	Change T to 2500 degrees (correcting initial conditions)
@ Gives Error "Integration Steps greater than maximum 10,000" for ODESolver.C

# 2 - [constant/chemistryProperties]
	Change odeCoeffs.solver from seulex to Rosenbrock34
@ Runs simulation with correct Temperature IC and makes it to 3e-05 (ClockTime=244s)
			       ERROR - Integration Steps - 9.25e-05 (ClockTime=1494s)

# 3 - [constant/spraycloudProperties], subModels.stochasticCollisionModel
	Change collision model from trajectory to none in attempt to speed simulation up
	(particles should burn off early enough)
@ Runs simulation and makes it to 			      3e-05 (ClockTime=49s)
				ERROR - Integration Steps - 9.5e-05 (ClockTime=207s)

# 4 - [constant/chemistyProperties], odeCoeffs.solver
	Change solver and iterate
@ Euler, EulerSI - ERROR - Integration Steps - 5e-06 (ClockTime=4s)
@ RKCK45 - No errors even at 2e-04 (ClockTime=447s)
			   9.5e-05 (ClockTime=192s)

# 5 - [constant/spraycloudProperties], subModels.particleForces
	Comment out SphereDrag - Upon inspection of last run (Change #4), particles burn
	out to where drag should be negligbile for now at the very least
@ ERROR - Code gives Floating Point Error from rhoEqn.H:39 before first iteration
@ Adding SphereDrag back in for the meantime

# 6 - [meshCreationFiles/0.internal/p], outlet
	Changed Outlet BC from zeroGradient to totalPressure with
@ p0/value at 101,325 (Sea Level)-Causes Timestep drops to e-08 by 1e-05
@ p0/value at 5000000 (Same as internal) - 3e-05 (ClockTime=53s)
					 9.5e-05 (ClockTime=216s)
					   2e-04 (ClockTime=475s)

# 7 - [system/controlDict], deltaT
	Changed delta T to 1e-06 to hopefully bypass the integration limit error
@ Previous result, deltaT=2.5e-06 -> Error at 0.00222 (ClockTime=880s)
@ Integration step error at 0.001046 (ClockTime=471s)

$ {7/21/2021} While practicing visualization with Paraview, noticed a low pressure zone being moved from the injector to the converging portion before rebounding back to the pintle-injector. Checking outlet BC's:
	Total pressure was set to subsonic compressible. Adding in psi gives transonic compressible and adding in psi + gamma makes it supersonic compressible.

# 8 {7/21/2021} - [meshCreationFiles/p], outlet
	Adding entry for the Supersonic Compressible version of the Total Pressure 		Outlet condition --- psi and gamma as suboptions under type.
@	No effect on Integration Step Error
@

# 9 {7/21/2021} - New Script, Fix Recontruct
	Added script Follow.sh which executes "tail -f log.sprayfoam" for less typing
	Fixed Reconstruct script to use Run Functions instead of Clean Functions

{7/28/2021} - Results back from FERMI after maintanence.
	Simulation ran for about half the time after deltaT adjustment. Reverting change back to deltaT = 2.5e-06 and shipping case2 with changes #8 + #9.
	CASE2 SHIPPED

#10 {7/28/2021} - [system/controlDict], deltaT
	Iterating deltaT to see affect on integration Error
@	dt = 2.5e-06 -> t = 0.00222
@	dt = 1.0e-06 -> t = 0.001046
@	dt = 2.0e-06 -> t = 0.001046

{8/02/2021} CASE2 RECEIVED

$ Need to look at BC and setup of case, then will test again. This is most likely the cause of the Integration Step Error.

{8/02/2021} CASE3 CREATED

{8/02/2021} Case Uploaded to GitHub
Repository at: https://github.com/DaM00finMan/pintle-injector-research-openfoam.git

#11 {8/02/2021} - [meshCreationFiles/0.noInternal/p], outlet
	Changed pressure outlet type from totalPressure to freestream with freestreamValue = 101325
@	Integration Step Error at t = 0.00135182 (Improvement)

{8/03/2021} - Meeting with Popov, suggested change to Chemical Pre-exponential factor:

#12 {8/03/2021} - [chemkin/chem.inp]
	Changed the first value after the reaction (Pre-Exponential Factor) by reducing it by a factor of 1000 (-3 from exponent)
@	Ran until Simulation time-out (FERMI Run setting). Resultant Case file is 651GB. Cleaning case due to size.

#13 {8/09/2021} - [system/controlDict], writeInterval
	Changing writeInterval from 1e-05 to 1e-03 to reduce case file size.
@	Slurm Job Time Limit -> t = 0.148275 (ClockTime=346,197s)

#14 {8/18/2021} - [system/controlDict], writeInterval
	Changing writeInterval to 1e-04 to accomodate for the Time period of an acoustic oscillation from Sakaki (1000 Hz)
		- [batchscriptsmoll144], nodelist
	Changed nodelist to use 36 processes on 2 cores [44-45] to see if there is a big parallel improvement now.
		- [meshCreationFiles/controlVariables], Processors, EndTime
	Changed Processor count to match and edited EndTime to 0.5s
@	Slurm Job Time Limit -> t = 0.180663 (ClockTime=346,217s)

{9/03/2021} Preliminary Results presented in Thesis Proposal Presentation

$ Investigating models and conditions used

#15 {9/07/2021} - [system/fvSchemes]
	Change divSchemes from gauss upwind to gauss linear for higher order interpolation. 	divSchemes changed: div(phi,U), div(phid,p), div(phi,k), div(phi,epsilon).
	Change divSchemes.div(phi,Yi_h) to MUSCL for 2nd order unbounded schemed (No Linear)
	Change ddtSchemes default from Euler to backward.
		- [meshCreationFiles/0.noInternal/p], boundaryField.outlet
	Add uniform label to value that was left out previously (No affect to solution).
		- [constant/sprayCloudProperties], parcelsPerSecond
	Reduced value for both fuel and oxidizer by factor of 10 to increase compute speed.
@ 	Simulation runs. Full run not performed.
	Simulation reached endTime of 0.1 s (ClockTime=106,000 s) ~x3 speed increase from particle count drop

{9/15/2021} - Creating particleTest branch to test previously used differential schemes with lower particle count. This is to see if the combustion error was independednt of particle count or not.

#16 {9/15/2021} - BRANCH: particleTest [system/fvSchemes]
	Reverted change to file made in #15. To test for combustion with 1st order schemes.
@	Simulation completed on FERMI over the weekend after maintanence. Simulation progressed to coded end time of t = 0.1s (ClockTime=15,538s)
	~x10 speed increase from 2nd order schemes

#18 {9/22/2021} - BRANCH: particleTest [meshCreationFiles/0.noInternal/] p, T
	Adjusting boundary conditions.
	Pressure: Outlet condition changed to total pressure condition to create a nozzle pressure outflow condition.
		Supersonic Compressible condition by setting psi, gamma, p0, and value, p0 = 0.5295 MPa at the outlet.
		Gamma changed to calculated value of 1.192.
		Internal Pressure Field corrected to 0.5 MPa = 500000 Pa.
	Temperature: Gamma changed to calculated value of 1.192 for O/F mixture.

{9/22/2021} - Creating branch TempCondition to test for the change to the Total Temp Outlet Condition at the same time as change #18

#19 {9/22/2021} - BRANCH: tempCondition [meshCreationFiles/0.noInternal/T.outlet]
	Outlet condition adjusted to calculated T0 value T0 = 185.27 K, NOT CONFIDENT in this value.
	To account for chemical reactions including data for 300-5000K only. The value used is 300K for T0.
	Change performed in a seperate branch to conduct a parallel test.
@	Acoustic waves forming in mid-chamber region. Bad solution for lowTemp BC.

#20 {10/01/2021} - BRANCH: particleTest [meshCreationFiles/0.noInternal/p]
	Pressure of combustion listed by Sakaki taken to be chamber (internalField) static pressure.
	p.internalField = 500000 Pa
	p.outlet.staticPressure = 53903 Pa
	Confirming total Temperature is set to T0 = 2500 K until a more accurate value is calculated.
@	Solution time step decreases to machine 0, or weird backflow present in nozzle

#21 {10/13/2021} - BRANCH: particleTest [meshCreationFiles/0.noInternal/p]
	Changing chamber pressure to outlet value for initial condition to have the
	resultant acoustic pressure wave to form at injector and propogate downstream
	rather than from the outlet upstream.
	p.internalField = 53901
	Working on creating a variable internalField for initial conditions from
	isentropic nozzle calculations.
