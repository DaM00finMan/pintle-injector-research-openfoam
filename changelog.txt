//------------ChangeLog for Research OpenFoam Case-------------------//

Starting with Case1c_retry, based off of the import of the last working
and tested case directory from the FERMI server, case4_ReadyToRun.tar.gz.
The changelog was started on 7/01/2021 in order to keep track of changes
and the results of the changes to the program to try to narrow down and 
track the possible cause of the problem with the simulation

Key for ChangeLog:

{7/01/2021}

%% case1c_retry branched from case4_ReadyToRun.tar.gz
$ Unchanged from being unpacked, makes it to 3e-05 w/o lowering timestep
# 1 - [meshCreationFiles/0.noInternal/T]
	Change T to 2500 degrees (correcting initial conditions)
@ Gives Error "Integration Steps greater than maximum 10,000" for ODESolver.C

# 2 - [constant/chemistryProperties]
	Change odeCoeffs.solver from seulex to Rosenbrock34
@ Runs simulation with correct Temperature IC and makes it to 3e-05 (ClockTime=244s)
			       ERROR - Integration Steps - 9.25e-05 (ClockTime=1494s)

# 3 - [constant/spraycloudProperties], subModels.stochasticCollisionModel
	Change collision model from trajectory to none in attempt to speed simulation up
	(particles should burn off early enough)
@ Runs simulation and makes it to 			      3e-05 (ClockTime=49s)
				ERROR - Integration Steps - 9.5e-05 (ClockTime=207s)

# 4 - [constant/chemistyProperties], odeCoeffs.solver
	Change solver and iterate
@ Euler, EulerSI - ERROR - Integration Steps - 5e-06 (ClockTime=4s)
@ RKCK45 - No errors even at 2e-04 (ClockTime=447s)
			   9.5e-05 (ClockTime=192s)

# 5 - [constant/spraycloudProperties], subModels.particleForces
	Comment out SphereDrag - Upon inspection of last run (Change #4), particles burn
	out to where drag should be negligbile for now at the very least
@ ERROR - Code gives Floating Point Error from rhoEqn.H:39 before first iteration
@ Adding SphereDrag back in for the meantime

# 6 - [meshCreationFiles/0.internal/p], outlet
	Changed Outlet BC from zeroGradient to totalPressure with
@ p0/value at 101,325 (Sea Level)-Causes Timestep drops to e-08 by 1e-05
@ p0/value at 5000000 (Same as internal) - 3e-05 (ClockTime=53s)
					 9.5e-05 (ClockTime=216s)
					   2e-04 (ClockTime=475s)

# 7 - [system/controlDict], deltaT
	Changed delta T to 1e-06 to hopefully bypass the integration limit error
@ Previous result, deltaT=2.5e-06 -> Error at 0.00222 (ClockTime=880s)
@ Integration step error at 0.001046 (ClockTime=471s)

$ {7/21/2021} While practicing visualization with Paraview, noticed a low pressure zone being moved from the injector to the converging portion before rebounding back to the pintle-injector. Checking outlet BC's:
	Total pressure was set to subsonic compressible. Adding in psi gives transonic compressible and adding in psi + gamma makes it supersonic compressible.

# 8 {7/21/2021} - [meshCreationFiles/p], outlet
	Adding entry for the Supersonic Compressible version of the Total Pressure 		Outlet condition --- psi and gamma as suboptions under type.
@	No effect on Integration Step Error
@	

# 9 {7/21/2021} - New Script, Fix Recontruct
	Added script Follow.sh which executes "tail -f log.sprayfoam" for less typing
	Fixed Reconstruct script to use Run Functions instead of Clean Functions

{7/28/2021} - Results back from FERMI after maintanence.
	Simulation ran for about half the time after deltaT adjustment. Reverting change back to deltaT = 2.5e-06 and shipping case2 with changes #8 + #9.
	CASE2 SHIPPED

#10 {7/28/2021} - [system/controlDict], deltaT
	Iterating deltaT to see affect on integration Error
@	dt = 2.5e-06 -> t = 0.00222
@	dt = 1.0e-06 -> t = 0.001046
@	dt = 2.0e-06 -> t = 0.001046

{8/02/2021} CASE2 RECEIVED

$ Need to look at BC and setup of case, then will test again. This is most likely the cause of the Integration Step Error.

{8/02/2021} CASE3 CREATED

{8/02/2021} Case Uploaded to GitHub
Repository at: https://github.com/DaM00finMan/pintle-injector-research-openfoam.git

#11 {8/02/2021} - [meshCreationFiles/0.noInternal/p], outlet
	Changed pressure outlet type from totalPressure to freestream with freestreamValue = 101325
@	Integration Step Error at t = 0.00135182 (Improvement)

{8/03/2021} - Meeting with Popov, suggested change to Chemical Pre-exponential factor:

#12 {8/03/2021} - [chemkin/chem.inp]
	Changed the first value after the reaction (Pre-Exponential Factor) by reducing it by a factor of 1000 (-3 from exponent)
@	

{8/06/2021} - FERMI Still running case with Change #12! Very good sign!
	Updated OpenFoamVM to have OpenFOAM-9 in addition to OpenFOAM-8! Working on a github branch for this version to incorporate changes.

#13 {8/06/2021} - Updated files to work with OpenFOAM-9.
	[constant/sprayCloudProperties] renamed to constant/cloudProperties
	[constant/cloudProperties] -> added "type	sprayCloud;"
	[Allrun] -> using reactingFoam solver now
	[meshCreationFiles/0.noInternal/p], outlet
		added uniform type before 101325 value for freestream
$ Incredibly faster simulation! Commiting and Pushing to git with above changes to branch 'of9'
	t = 0.005076 (ClockTime=138s)
